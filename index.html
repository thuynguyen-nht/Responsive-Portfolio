					<p>
						Hello world! I'm Thuy Nguyen. I am a creative Web Developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have great interest in new technologies since from a young age. However, since my young age,
						my
						parents has been guiding me to follow health care career. I got my BS degree in Biological
						Science.
						After working for awhile, I realized that beside earning money, I want to enjoy my job too.
						Finally,
						I decided to push forward and pursue my interest as a Web Developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a fan of simplicity. I want my website to versatile, lightweight, and reflect the beauty of
						minimalism but fully interact with users.
